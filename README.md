# PlanarRobotDynamicModel
A code to generate the dynamic model of any Planar Robot using the Robotics Toolbox

### **What is this?**
It is a script that can generate the matrices M, C and G for the following equation 'M*Qdd+C*Qd+G=tau'
### **What will you obtain?**
• A 3D representation of the robot's current configuration.\
• Each matrix generated will be saved into .txt or .m files.
### **How to use it?**
**Step 1:** Install the robotic toolbox.\
**Step 2:** Run the MAIN file.\
**Step 3:** Read the code carefully.\

To install the Robotics Toolbox follow the steps. \
1. Open Matlab.\
2. Go to the 'HOME' tab and select 'Open'.\
3. Select the RTB-10.4.mltbx file and Open it.\
4. It will be installed automatically.\
5. Close the 'installation complete' window.\
6. Close the 'Help' window.\
7. Close the 'Add-On Manager' window.\
8. Enjoy life.\

To test the example code.\
1. Go to the example folder.\
2. Open the 'MAIN' file and run it.\
3. Change folder directory if asked.\
4. If there are additional files, keep them in the same folder as the 'MAIN' file.\
5. The code is commented, please read it carefully.\
6. Having a backup of the original code is always a good idea.\
